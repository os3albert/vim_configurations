# vim_configurations

This repo is here to reduce time in configuring the base vim configurations
between different editors. I would subdivide this repo into levels so everyone step by step can add more informations on top of their vim configuration and have a centralized repo where to find vim configurations. I try not to add heavy addons, and I try to add the minimum of them.

## Base Configuration
### OVERVIEW:
- [ ] vim esc mode standardization
- [ ] leader for calling main dev activities
- [ ] basic vimrc configurations for all editors

## Intermediate Configurations
### WORKING ON...
